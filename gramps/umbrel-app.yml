  **External search**

  The highlight in this release is the new external search feature. It adds a button in the person view that offers a selection of external genealogical repositories to search for the person's details. Inspired by Gramps desktop's web connect addon, it currently includes the providers CompGen, FamilySearch, Ancestry, MyHeritage, Geneanet, WikiTree, and Find a Grave.

  Users can easily hide the providers they don't need and can add custom providers by entering a search URL with template variables.


  **Improved keyboard shortcuts**

  The new keyboard shortcut `e` allows to quickly toggle the edit mode in any of the primary object (e.g. person) views. In addition to pressing the `?`` key, the documentation of available keyboard shortcuts can now also be found on the help page added in v25.11.0.


  **Backend improvements: more powerful AI assistant**

  Version 3.6.0 of Gramps Web API, the server component of the web app, has been released this week. See [its release notes](https://github.com/gramps-project/gramps-web-api/releases/tag/v3.6.0) for details about the improvements it brings. Most importantly, it takes the Gramps Web AI assistant to the next level by allowing it to call genealogical tools.
